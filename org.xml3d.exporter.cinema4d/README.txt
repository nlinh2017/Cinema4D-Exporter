Assets exporting plugins
--------------------------

About
-----
At the Computer Graphics Lab of Saarland Universtiy we have developed a collection 
of plugins to be able to export assets from various DC tools to the major formats 
in use by the URay Rendering Platform.

XML3DExporter is Py4D script to export models assets from Cinema4D to the XML3D format
developed at the DFKI, GmbH. This format is a minimal extension to HTML that allows to
render fully 3D scenes using any rendering engine, be it rasterizer or ray tracer.

This core plugins have been developed at Computer Graphics Lab at Saarland University by
Ken Patrick Dahm. The exporter classes for XML3D has been developed by Kristian Sons.
